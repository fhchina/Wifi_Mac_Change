Wifi Mac Change for Android

I made this so I could change my wifi mac address.
This works on my Galaxy Avant and Galaxy Light with "Chainfire SuperSU" and "Stericson Busybox" installed.
I am told this works on other devices also but I cannot verify those claims.
Wifi Mac Change for Android has NO WARANTY written or expressed.
If you paid for this Source Code or Application get a refund because you didn't pay me.
