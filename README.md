Wifi Mac Change for Android

Mac Address Change for Android

I made this so I could change my wifi mac address.
This works on Galaxy Avant and Galaxy Light with "Chainfire SuperSU" and "Stericson Busybox, RootShell, RootTools".
I am told this works on other devices but I cannot verify those claims.
